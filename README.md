Motivation
The motivation behind creating this Uber project stemmed from a desire to streamline transportation services, ensuring seamless connectivity between riders and drivers while enhancing overall user experience. We aimed to address the inefficiencies and pain points present in traditional taxi services by leveraging technology to provide a convenient, reliable, and efficient transportation solution.

Problem Solving & Functionality
This project serves to bridge the gap between riders and drivers, offering a platform where users can request rides conveniently through a mobile application. Key features include:

User Authentication: Secure registration and login for both riders and drivers.
Ride Booking: Users can request rides, specifying their pickup and drop-off locations.
Real-time Tracking: Riders can track their assigned driver's location in real-time.
Payment Integration: Seamless payment processing through various methods like credit/debit cards, digital wallets, etc.
Driver Management: Drivers can accept or reject ride requests based on their availability.
Technology Stack
We chose specific technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and a smooth user experience:

Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile application development.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for building robust APIs.
Database: MongoDB for storing user and ride data efficiently.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
Mapping & Navigation: Integration with Google Maps API for location services.
Challenges Faced & Future Features
During development, we encountered challenges such as optimizing real-time tracking for better accuracy and reliability, and ensuring secure payment transactions. In the future, we aim to implement features such as:

Rating & Feedback System: Allowing users to rate and provide feedback on their ride experience.
Advanced Routing Algorithms: Optimizing driver allocation and route selection for improved efficiency.
Promotions & Discounts: Introducing promotional offers and discounts to enhance user engagement.
